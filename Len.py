# So, now that you have created your first calculator, we will look at other functions. One of them is called "len".
# What len does is take an input and count the number of characters in that input. I have created my own version of len (in list of functions that I have made).
# How do you use len?
# Well, considering you now know inputs and variables, lets combine len with them to make a program that counts the characters in what you input.

sentence = input("Enter a string. It can be as long or as short as you want (reminder: strings are collections of words or letters): ")
