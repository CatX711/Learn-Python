# Python is a very complex and powerful programming language, but that does not necessarily mean that it is hard to understand, in fact, as soon as you open Python,
# you can get started straight away!

# Once you open the idle shell, you can create your first code.

print("Hello, world!")

# The print function in python tells the computer to display something on the screen. That something is what you choose it to say, like for example, the famous, 'hello world'
# Give it a try yourself, type, 'print' (always in lowercase) and then opened and closed brackets, and inside those brackets, two inverted commas, and inside those your text.
# When run, the computer will say whatever you tell it to do (just don't make it say rude words like 'bottoms', please, I once did that and my grandma fainted at the sight!

# Now you can print whatever you want onto the screen. Why not mess around with it? Have some fun and practice the function?
